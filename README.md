# BinarySearchTree_Implementation
A binary search tree implemented with an iterative insert function, a recursive remove function, and a recursive remove max helper function. These files come from an assignment in my Data Structures and Algorithms class, taught by Dr. Lee S. Koh, at Texas State University. The header file was given by professor, implementation was to be (partially) filled out by the student.

These files show not only my understanding of one of the building block structures in C++, but also my ability to code and comment in a neat and concise fashion.

## Purpose

Implements basic binary searh tree functions for testing and utilization, such as:
```
bst_insert - Mutator
An iterative insert function

bst_remove - Mutator
A recursive removal function

bst_remove_max - Mutator
A recursive removal helper function
```
